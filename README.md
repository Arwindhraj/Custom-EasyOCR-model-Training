# Custom-EasyOCR-model-Training
This repository showcases my contributions to the custom EasyOCR model training project. I've taken the initiative to improve and fine-tune the existing project, making it more effective in recognizing text from images. The primary focus of this effort was to enhance the accuracy and versatility of the EasyOCR model through careful data preprocessing, model configuration, and training.

## Fixed some Bugs

I have cloned the original repositories. This repository contains existing project for training a custom EasyOCR model.
